## Ndexcode the Ndebele based Programming Language Prebuilt Binaries

What: Ndebele based programming language

Why: Because I can, you and what army gone stop me?
Well the idea behind it is that it will be easier to have people play around with coding in Ndebele and be able to grasp programming concepts that they can use if they decide to pursue it further and learn more serious languages.

Ndexcode is a Ndebele programming language, based on the Pinecode Programming language (https://github.com/wmww/Pinecone).
I decided to fork Pinecone and rebuild it incorporating a Southern Ndebele spin on it.


##Sabona Zimbawe (We don't do Hello World Here)

1. Download the binary from (https://github.com/zimspy007/Ndexcode-Binaries), be it for Windows or MacOS and exctract it somewhere.

2. Save the following in a ".ndx" source file:
	
	bhala: "Sabona Zimbabwe"

3. Open a terminal window and navigate to where you extracted the Ndexcode binary.

4. Run it as follows in a terminal window:

	Windows:

			ndexcode PathToSourceFile\hello_sourceFileName.ndx

or for MacOS

	./ndexcode \PathToSourceFile\hello_sourceFileName.ndx

## Tutorials

For more code examples and an introduction to the language, check out the tutorials folder in the repository. No I mean check out Izibonelo folder.

## The source code is available at https://github.com/zimspy007/Ndexcode

## Current State
The features that are currently implemented are as follows:

Primitive data types Bool, Int and Dub<br/>
All the operators you would expect (+, *, %, :, =, >, <=, &&, etc.)<br/>
Single and multi line comments<br/>
Flow control (if, if/else, while loop, for loop)<br/>
Constants<br/>
Data structs<br/>
Qoqa aka Tuples<br/>
Inani arrays aka Int Arrays<br/>
Functions<br/>
Amabala and various Amabala operations aka String<br/>
User input<br/>
Running system commands<br/>
Interpreter for rapid development and simplicity<br/>
Transpiler to C++ for max performance<br/>
